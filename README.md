# Running the application:
 - Run db.py to initate the database server (this does not need to be restarted every game)
 - Run team-local-tactics.py to initiate the server
 - Then run client.py twice to connect two clients to the server
 - If you wish to run another game rerun team-local-tactics.py and two clients, db.py does not need to be restarted!


# If you want to clear the match history:
 - Just run the clearMatchHistory.py script
